# demographic-data-analyzer-project-FFCDAP
This project was completed in part for the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python course.

## What does it do?

This project defines a function that takes the given dataset 'adult.data.csv' containing demographic data, loads the CSV into a pandas dataframe, and performs analyses upon the data. This project breaks down the data by race, education, earnings, nationality, and the relationship between eductation and salary, and more. When percentages are calculated, they are rounded to the nearest tenth.

NOTE: The 'sketches.ipynb' file was the file used to test sections of code before placing it in the function.

## Dependencies

- Pandas
