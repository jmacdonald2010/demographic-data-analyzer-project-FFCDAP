# Changelog for in-progress

Passed the highest earning country percentage test. All tests passed. Commit/Push, then merge to main, then edit readme.

### 03/16/2021 13:00
Corrected the 'what country has the highest percentage of people earning > 50k' test, albeit in not the most straight-ahead way, but it works. One test left to correct (highest earning country percentage), which should be pretty straight-ahead. Done for the day on this project.

### 03/16/2021 12:01
Corrected Lower Edu Rich test, passed. Next will be trying to figure out where the highest earning country code went wrong and correcting it.

### 03/16/2021 11:57
Corrected the Higher Edu rich test, passed. Next, correcting Lower Edu rich w/ the same method.

### 03/16/2021 11:53
Tests failed the following:

- Higher edu rich:
    - should be 46.5, is 10.7
    - possible error:
        - Calc'd percent from total size of DF, not total amt of people w/ adv degrees.
- Highest earning country:
    - Have not checked error here yet
    - Answer should be Iran?
- Highest Earning country percentage:
    - should be 41.9
    - have not examined error.
- Lower Edu Rich:
    - Likely a sim. error to higher edu rich
    - should be 17.4, not 13.4

Kept adding filling in the functions. Little bit more work to do, then on to to testing it. 

### 2/25/2021 09:47
Project has been started. Copied the function template to my own .py file, but doing most of my 'sketching' in a jupyter notebook. The notebook cannot be run sequentially and is mainly being used to test the data analysis/manipulation before adding to the .py file. Nothing has been tested yet.
